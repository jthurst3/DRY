	Introduction
		Who came up with DRY?
		Can you code DRY? (our question)
	Related work
		Cite other related work
	Design and implementation: DRYness score and setup
		explain how our program can fail at computing a DRYness score
	Heuristics: Iteration 1 Heuristic
		Explain why some trivial nodes get scores of 0 and others scores of 1
		Specify to what extent DRYness score increases if two block statements are equal
	Heuristics: All Pairs Native Heuristic
		Clarify how I'm computing dryness score
	Heuristics: All Pairs Weighted Heuristic -- fix circled typo
	Baker Heuristic -- explain modified version and cite Baker's paper
	Explain why tree edit distance heuristic is hard to compute and not well-defined
	Results
		Add graph/figures showing DRYness results
		This is where specific results go, like scores and computations
	Conclusions (and Future Work)
		Fix circled typo
		This is where abstract conclusions go, like how successful we were and how this relates to the overall "modularity" conversation
		future work suggestions:
			tree edit distance heuristic, defining it, and implementing it recursively
			testing on students' submissions for an assignment, and possibly making it available to amateur programmers
	Acknowledgements
		fix spelling of Joe's name
		thank the people who end up proofreading my final version
	Move implementation stuff to README
	Bibliography -- delete URLs for everything except websites/miscellaneous
