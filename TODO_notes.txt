Lint code
Writeup
	Design and implementation: DRYness score and setup
		explain how our program can fail at computing a DRYness score
	Heuristics: Iteration 1 Heuristic
		Explain why some trivial nodes get scores of 0 and others scores of 1
		Specify to what extent DRYness score increases if two block statements are equal
	Heuristics: All Pairs Native Heuristic
		Clarify how I'm computing dryness score
	Baker Heuristic -- explain modified version and cite Baker's paper
	Explain why tree edit distance heuristic is hard to compute and not well-defined
	Results
		This is where specific results go, like scores and computations
	Conclusions (and Future Work)
		This is where abstract conclusions go, like how successful we were and how this relates to the overall "modularity" conversation
		future work suggestions:
			tree edit distance heuristic, defining it, and implementing it recursively
			testing on students' submissions for an assignment, and possibly making it available to amateur programmers
