Javaparser
	- attribute count
	- parses into an AST

Structural similarity measure S(m1, m2):
	input = 2 subtrees of Java parse tree
	if nodes are the same and there are no children, return 1
	else if nodes are the same, add small value
	output = average(S(t1, t2) + D(t1) + D(t2)) for all t1, t2 subtrees of m1, m2

DRY measure D(m)
	input = subtree of Java parse tree
	if there is one node, return 0
	else output = average(S(m1, m2)) for all m1, m2 subtrees of m

TODO:
	- write code for this metric
	- write test cases (hand-coded at first)
	- evaluate efficacy of this metric + report on it for this Wednesday

All pairs:
	- Create a visitor that goes through and gets lists of all different types of a program (e.g. all StatementLists)
	- For each type, compare pairs using Edit Distance
