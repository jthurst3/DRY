Writeup
	Design and implementation: DRYness score and setup
		explain how our program can fail at computing a DRYness score
	Heuristics: Iteration 1 Heuristic
		Explain why some trivial nodes get scores of 0 and others scores of 1
		Specify to what extent DRYness score increases if two block statements are equal
	Heuristics: All Pairs Native Heuristic
		Clarify how I'm computing dryness score
	Baker Heuristic -- explain modified version and cite Baker's paper
	Explain why tree edit distance heuristic is hard to compute and not well-defined
