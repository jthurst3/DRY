Abstract (p58)
	Generalization of Hamming distance and longest common subsequences between strings to one between languages
	Similarity metrics between regular languages are computable
	Self-similarity of regular languages by studying "amplitude" of an automaton => how much execution of automaton fluctuates
	similarity between two real-world programs using Lempel-Ziv compression on runs at assembly level

Introduction (p58)
	Similarity between programs difficult to measure
	No agreement in research community about what is a good similarity metric (from Walstein et. al. 2007 [32])
