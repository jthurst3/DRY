Abstract (p1)
	More and more people are taking up computer programming courses, so instances of plagiarism will increase

Techniques students use for plagiarism (p2)
	Lexical changes (language independent)
		reworded comments
		formatting
		identifier names
		line number changes
	Structural changes (language dependent)
		loop replacement (e.g. for -> while)
		Nested if -> case
		change order of statements if it does not affect outcome
		procedure <-> function calls
		calls to procedure replaced by body of that procedure
		operand ordering (e.g. x < y <=> y >= x)

Why do programming students plagiarize? II.B
	most students that do do not fully understand how to program
	modifications usually obvious

Detection of plagiarism reduces to detecting program similarity:
	calculate + compare attribute counts
	compare structure of programs

Incremental comparison method (p3)
	Programs compared in original form
	Programs compared with max amount of whitespace removed
	Programs compared with all comments removed
	Programs compared with all comments and max whitespace removed
	Programs translated to a file of tokens (names, operators, loop statements, ...)

Neural network output (p3-4)
	submitted programs represented as a graph, with edges connecting two programs if they are sufficiently similar
		--> extend to methods within a program
