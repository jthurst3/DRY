Origins of program similairty (p1)
	coincidence
	"premeditated plagiarism"
	cooperation/collaboration between authors

Techniques used to disguise similarity (p2)
	Changing comments/formatting
	Changing identifiers
	Changing order of operations
	Changing data types (e.g. integer -> real)
	Equivalent expressions
	Adding redundant statements/variables
	Changing order of independent statements
	Changing structure of iteration statements
	Changing structure of selection statements (if/else vs case)
	Replacing procedure call by procedure body
	Introducing non-structured statements
	Combinations of the above

Attribute count method (p4)
	Count total number of unique operators and unique operands
	Count total number of assignment statements, lines of code, variables, keywords (Berghel and Sallach [1])
	Measure similarity of programs based on these counts

Structural methods are harder (p5)
	Code optimization to extract details of structure (Robinson and Soffa [14])

Hard to balance selectivity and recall (p5 sec 5.3)
